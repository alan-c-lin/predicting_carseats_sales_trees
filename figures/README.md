# Figures

This folder contains exported plots from the `predicting_carseats_sales_trees` project for easy reference: 

- `figure1_rf_test_mse.png` â€” Test mean squared error (MSE) of random forests with varying numbers of features.

All plots are also embedded in the Jupyter Notebook outputs (`.ipynb`, `.html`, and `.pdf`).
